# PikminClicky
A clicking game honoring Pikmin using React!

# Flow
Select an image and the rest will be shuffled. Try to remember which images you've selected and don't select it more than once or the game will reset along with the score. There is a maximum score of 18.

# Challenges
Figuring out a smooth way to shuffle the array of images, as well as learning React and setting state was a bit of a challenge. However, I had a lot of fun and finally got to pay homage to one of my absolute favorite Nintendo games, Pikmin. What can be better?

# Future Goals
I would like to have a winning modal pop up after correctly clicking on all of the Pikmin, and I would also like to work out the shaking animation when an image is selected twice.
